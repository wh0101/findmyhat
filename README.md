This project is really tough for me, what i liked was that I'm exposed to new challeneges, and the things we can do with programming.

I struggled with alot of things in the project and I was not able to complete it, but more on the basics of constructors, I did not know how the placement of the codes and what I can use, even when I think the logic is right. 

I think this experience could be better if I am better equipped with the basics better. I am really unsure of how constructors work and how we can use them with functions etc.
